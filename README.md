# 🌦️ Weather Prediction App

A machine learning-powered weather prediction app built with Python. It uses a trained model to forecast weather conditions based on historical data and provides an interactive interface for users.

##  Features
-  Predicts weather using a trained ML model (`model.pkl`)
-  Uses historical weather data (`weather.csv`)
-  Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training
-  `app.py` for running the prediction interface (Streamlit or FastAPI)
-  Clean project structure for easy deployment and extension
